## Simple yet useful, Non-financial-advice-giving-tool and tracker based off a free API, to tell if you if you should sell or not
Python script uses a a free coingecko api and general technical analysis and prints if you should sell or not. It is very fast. Feel free to modify as you wish but this was done with efficiency in mind and not financial motives nor tracking of any wallets, even if current wallets allow that. While we love decentralization, we also believe certain users deserve levels of privacy unknown to Man and whether you like it or not, The Gov needs the privacy while no one follows the money because someone will but efficiency is too fast. If this were sarcasm I wouldn't be so serious that I know it's as important as anything, which leaves your brain a bit puzzled. Perfection is Divine and clues may be subjective if not objective of a foundation that requires more speed and expertise rather than everything and everyone (which is a valid point) this the glitch in the matrix is here.
